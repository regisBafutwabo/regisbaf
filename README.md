# Intro

This is my personal website which contains a list of blogs and some of the music I enjoy at the moment.

## Content Templates
In case you want to use it as your template, 
- Create a `.env` file 
- Copy the content of `.env.example` to your newly created `.env` file.
- Fill up the `.env` file
- Modify the contents in `/src/constants/content.tsx` with your information.
