# Intro

This is my personal website but I plan to start writing some articles in the `blog` page on it so be on the lookoutðŸ‘€. Meanwhile, you can be looking at my current top songs in the `top-tracks` pageðŸ˜‰

## Content Templates
In case you want to use it as your template, 
- Create a `.env` file 
- Copy the content of `.env.example` to your newly created `.env` file.
- Fill up the `.env` file
- Modify the contents in `/src/constants/content.tsx` with your information.
